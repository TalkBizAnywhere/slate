# Introduction

Welcome to the Cadence API! You can use our API to create new interpretation and translation jobs on [Cadence's platform](https://www.talkbusinessanywhere.com).

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).

# Basics

All methods must be called using HTTPS. Arguments can be passed as POST, with query params placed in the body of the JSON payload. The response contains a JSON object, which contains a top-level property status, indicating success or failure.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

API keys are used to authenticate users of our API. You can [contact us](mailto:matt@talkbusinessanywhere.com) to request a new API key.

The API key is expected to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
